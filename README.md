# Licensir [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unnawut/licensir.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unnawut/licensir) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/unnawut/licensir/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/unnawut/licensir?branch=master)

An Elixir mix task that list the license(s) of all installed packages in your project.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `licensir` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:licensir, "~> 0.4", only: :dev, runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

This mix task in most cases only needs to be run on a development machine and independent from the runtime applications, hence the `only: dev, runtime: false` options.

#### Install locally

If you do not wish to include this tool as part of your dependencies, you may also install it locally by running:

```elixir
$ mix archive.install hex licensir 0.4.0
```

Now you can access this tool from any path on your local machine that has access to `mix`.

## Usage

Run the command to get the list of packages and their licenses:

```shell
mix licenses
```

The command above should return an output similar to below (example from [phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix)):

```shell
$ mix licenses
cowboy 2.2.2            -> Undefined
cowlib 2.1.0            -> Undefined
earmark                 -> Apache 2 (see the file LICENSE for details)
ex_doc                  -> Unsure (found: Apache 2.0, Apache 2)
gettext                 -> Apache 2.0
inch_ex                 -> MIT

```
